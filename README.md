This application is designed to calculate the electrical energy required, in kWh, for a thermal vehicle if it were converted into an electric vehicle.

To perform this calculation, the application uses the calorific value of fuels to determine the equivalence between the consumption of one liter of fuel and the energy generated in kWh.

Parameters considered:

The type of fuel used (gasoline, diesel, etc.).
Average fuel consumption in liters per 100 km (L/100 km).
Vehicle configuration, particularly if it is towing a trailer.
The average number of kilometers driven per day.
The season, which impacts energy performance.
